### Installation

#### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend folder:

{I did all my backend inside the main folder}}
cd movie-app-backend

Create a .env file and fill your credentials

PORT=http://localhost:5000 {Default port}
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret

### Frontend Setup 
cd movie-app-frontend {My front end wa screated in a separate folder}

Create a .env file 

REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
REACT_APP_TMDB_API_KEY=your_tmdb_api_key

Install dependencies and start React development server: 
npm install
npm start

** Usage **
â—¾ Register a new user or login with existing credentials

â—¾ Browse popular movies on the dashboard

## Deployment

This app is currently **not deployed** to a public domain.

To test and use the app, please follow the instructions below to run it locally on your machine.



1. Clone the repository:  
   git clone https://github.com/Oluoba/movieRecommendationApp.git
2. Install dependencies:
    npm install
3. Create a .env file in the root directory with the following variables: 
    DATABASE_URL="your_database_connection_string"
    TMDB_API_KEY="your_tmdb_api_key"
    JWT_SECRET="your_jwt_secret"
4. Run Prisma migrations (I used mongoose initialy):
    npx prisma migrate dev --name init

5. Start the server:
    node server.js
6. Use Postman or any API client to test endpoints at http://localhost:PORT/api/... (replace PORT with your server port, usually 3000, 5000 or as configured). 

### Testing with Postman
â—¾ Use the Register endpoint to create a user:
POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/register
Body example (JSON):

{
  "username": "yourusername",
  "email": "youremail@address.com",
  "password": "yourpassword"
}

â—¾ Use the Login endpoint to authenticate:
POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/login
Body example (JSON):

{
  "email": "youremail@address.com",
  "password": "yourpassword"
}
â—¾ Use the returned JWT token in your requests to protected routes by setting the header:
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN 
I.e., Key is - Authorization and Value is - Bearer - j56*************
