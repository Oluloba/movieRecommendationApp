# ðŸŽ¬ Movie Recommendation App

A full-stack web application that helps users discover movies, search by genre, year, popularity, and also save their favorites movies. This app integrates with the TMDb (The Movie Database) API to provide up-to-date movie data.

The project is structured with separate backend and frontend folders:

backend/ â€” REST API built with Node.js, Express, and Prisma for database management.

frontend/ â€” React.js user interface for seamless interaction and visualization.

## Features

- User authentication with JWT and protected routes
- Fetch and display popular movies from TMDb API
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile
- User profile page to manage account info
- Clean UI with React Router navigation
- Backend API built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB

---

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** React, React Router, Axios, CSS
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express, postgreSQL, JWT
- **External API:** TMDb (The Movie Database) API for movie data (https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api)

---

## The Process

- Node.js and npm installed
- TMDb API key ([Get one here](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api))

### Installation

#### Backend Setup

Navigate to the backend folder:
cd movie-app-backend

â—¾â—¾ Create a .env file and fill your credentials: 
	PORT=http://localhost:5000 {Default port}
	DATABASE URL="your postgres URL"
	JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret

### Frontend Setup 
cd movie-app-frontend 

â—¾â—¾ Create a .env file:
	REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
	REACT_APP_TMDB_API_KEY=your_tmdb_api_key
 ### Notes
âœ… Keep your TMDb API key secure; never expose it publicly. Add your .env file to .gitignore. 
âœ… JWT authentication protects user data and routes.

â—¾â—¾ Install dependencies and Run Prisma migrations (I used mongoose initialy):
    npx prisma migrate dev --name init
â—¾â—¾ Start the server:
    node server.js
â—¾â—¾ Use Postman or any API client to test endpoints at http://localhost:PORT/api/... (replace PORT with your server port, usually 3000, 5000 or as configured). 

### Testing with Postman
â—¾ Use the Register endpoint to create a user:
POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/register
Body example (JSON):

{
  "username": "yourusername",
  "email": "youremail@address.com",
  "password": "yourpassword"
}

â—¾ Use the Login endpoint to authenticate:
POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/login
Body example (JSON):

{
  "email": "youremail@address.com",
  "password": "yourpassword"
}
â—¾ Use the returned JWT token in your requests to protected routes by setting the header:
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN 
I.e., Key is - Authorization and Value is - Bearer - j56*************
